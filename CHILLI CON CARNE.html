<p>This     was     one     of     the     first     easy    
recipes    I    learnt    to    cook    and    can    be    
mastered    in    just    a    few    attempts!    It’s    
healthy,    cheap    and    tasty    and    makes    
the    ultimate    student    food.    You    can    
make    a    large    batch    of    this    and    then    
store    in    the    fridge    for    days    or    freeze    
for    weeks.    </p>
